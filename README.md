Payroll
Payroll system for small businesses like water station small restaurants construction and many more.

Aim to help the workers get their payroll without any problems.

Example 
Workers who  worked for 8 hours and 6 days a week there are situations where workers worked overtime but they don't get paid since sometimes there are no records of them working overtime hence they dont get paid properly for the work they did.

Another example is:
When workers asked for like an advanced payment "bale"  midway through the week for their daily needs but sometimes business owners tend to forget to record or tally this advance payment hence they are overpaying their workers when its time for their payroll.
